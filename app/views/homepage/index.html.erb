<h2>Clinical Trial Connector</h2>
<p>To help patients find clinical trials that they could benefit from, the National Brain Tumor Society has launched its Clinical Trial Connector.</p>

<p>Clinical trials are research studies that involve people, and are designed to test the most promising new treatments. These studies test new ways to prevent, detect, diagnose, or treat diseases and are a final and crucial step on the path to developing better treatments for brain tumor patients today. Most of todayâ€™s effective treatments for cancer are based on the results of clinical trial results. Yet, currently only about 3% of adults cancer patients will ever participate in a clinical trial. This low figure can drastically hinder the ability of researchers to get more treatments to patients. A large analysis of cancer clinical trials has found that 40% of trials failed to achieve minimum patient enrollment needed to proceed, and more than three-out-of-five critical late stage trials failed to do so. Further, according to the National Cancer Institute, if we were able to increase the average participation of adults in cancer clinical trials to even just 10%, studies could be completed in just one year, instead of the typical three-to-five as it stands currently. Thus, no matter how much funding and effort are put into finding new and better treatment for brain tumors, research cannot move forward toward approval for use without the help of clinical trial participants.</p>
