<h2>Overview & Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>To help patients find clinical trials that they could benefit from, the National Brain Tumor Society has launched its Clinical Trial Connector.</p>

<p>Clinical trials are research studies that involve people, and are designed to test the most promising new treatments. These studies test new ways to prevent, detect, diagnose, or treat diseases and are a final and crucial step on the path to developing better treatments for brain tumor patients today. Most of today’s effective treatments for cancer are based on the results of clinical trial results. Yet, currently only about 3% of adults cancer patients will ever participate in a clinical trial. This low figure can drastically hinder the ability of researchers to get more treatments to patients. A large analysis of cancer clinical trials has found that 40% of trials failed to achieve minimum patient enrollment needed to proceed, and more than three-out-of-five critical late stage trials failed to do so. Further, according to the National Cancer Institute, if we were able to increase the average participation of adults in cancer clinical trials to even just 10%, studies could be completed in just one year, instead of the typical three-to-five as it stands currently. Thus, no matter how much funding and effort are put into finding new and better treatment for brain tumors, research cannot move forward toward approval for use without the help of clinical trial participants. </p>

<h4>What is the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector?</h4>
<p>National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector is a tool that helps patients find clinical trials that are right for them. It is a web-based service that lists brain tumor clinical trials that are currently recruiting and, through a series of filters, identifies trials that fit individual patients’ specific medical profile.</p>

<p>You can browse trials, filter trials based on medical history, location, and age. This service is to help the Brain Tumor Community keep informed of trials enrolling in their areas. </p>

<h4>What happens to my personal information?</h4>
<p>All your information is protected. The information you enter into the search area will be compared to the participation criteria of trials. The web-based service will show possible matches, after which volunteers are responsible for reaching out to Trial Coordinators to discuss the trial further. At this point, the volunteer's identity may become known to the trial coordinator, but their personal medical information is kept private unless the volunteer chooses to share this information in a message to a coordinator.</p>

<p>The search information you enter is not stored, but our websites do use cookies. Please see our <%= link_to "Privacy Policy","http://www.braintumor.org/privacy-policy.html" %> and <%= link_to "Terms of Use","http://www.braintumor.org/terms.html" %> for more information.</p>

<h4>Why was the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector created?</h4>
<p>National Brain Tumor Society wanted to make finding the right trial for you as easy as possible. There is a need for participants in clinical trials [see information above] so that our community can find better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for people living with a brain tumor today, and all who will be diagnosed tomorrow. </p>

<h4>Who can use the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector?</h4>
<p>Everyone can use this resource, including patients, family members, caregivers, friends, healthy volunteers, etc. </p>

<h4>Where does the clinical trial information come from and how often is it updated?</h4>
<p>Clinical trials listed in the Connector are pulled from the United States’ government-sponsored website <%= link_to "clinicaltrials.gov", "https://clinicaltrials.gov/" %>. Trial listings and information are updated nightly. So be sure to check back often.</p>

<h4>How do we get our trial featured on the Blog?</h4>
<p>Please contact <%= link_to "Jennifer Helfer","mailto:jhelfer@braintumor.org" %> for more information regarding the Clinical Trial Blog. </p>

<h4>Are the listed or featured trials funded or endorsed by the National Brain Tumor Society?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. While, the National Brain Tumor Society may have had a part in funding some trials in the database, we certainly did not fund every trial listed as the Clinical Trial Connector lists every Brain Tumor trial that is recruiting volunteers and that is registered with clinicaltrial.gov.</p>

<p>Additionally, because we are a nonprofit patient advocacy organization, and not licensed physicians, we cannot endorse one trial over another. We can merely provide to you a full slate of options, for which it is then up to you and your medical team to decide the right course of treatment. </p>

<h4>How do I report issues?</h4>
