<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>

<h4>What is the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector?</h4>
<p>National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector is a tool that helps patients find clinical trials that are right for them. It is a web-based service that lists brain tumor clinical trials that are currently recruiting and, through a series of filters, identifies trials that fit individual patients’ specific medical profile.</p>

<p>You can browse trials, filter trials based on medical history, location, and age. This service is to help the Brain Tumor Community keep informed of trials enrolling in their areas. </p>

<h4>What happens to my personal information?</h4>
<p>All your information is protected. The information you enter into the search area will be compared to the participation criteria of trials. The web-based service will show possible matches, after which volunteers are responsible for reaching out to Trial Coordinators to discuss the trial further. At this point, the volunteer's identity may become known to the trial coordinator, but their personal medical information is kept private unless the volunteer chooses to share this information in a message to a coordinator.</p>

<h4>Why was the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector created?</h4>
<p>National Brain Tumor Society wanted to make finding the right trial for you as easy as possible. There is a need for participants in clinical trials [see information above] so that our community can find better treatments, and ultimately a cure, for people living with a brain tumor today, and all who will be diagnosed tomorrow. </p>

<h4>Who can use the National Brain Tumor Society’s Clinical Trial Connector?</h4>
<p>Everyone can use this resource, including patients, family members, caregivers, friends, healthy volunteers, etc. </p>

<h4>Where does the clinical trial information come from and how often is it updated?</h4>
<p>Clinical trials listed in the Connector are pulled from the United States’ government-sponsored website clinicaltrials.gov. Trial listings and information are updated nightly. So be sure to check back often.</p>

<h4>How do we get our trial featured on the Blog?</h4>
<p>Please contact Jennifer Helfer for more information regarding the Clinical Trial Blog. </p>

<h4>Are the listed or featured trials funded or endorsed by the National Brain Tumor Society?</h4>
<p>Not necessarily. While, the National Brain Tumor Society may have had a part in funding some trials in the database, we certainly did not fund every trial listed as the Clinical Trial Connector lists every Brain Tumor trial that is recruiting volunteers and that is registered with clinicaltrial.gov.</p>

<p>Additionally, because we are a nonprofit patient advocacy organization, and not licensed physicians, we cannot endorse one trial over another. We can merely provide to you a full slate of options, for which it is then up to you and your medical team to decide the right course of treatment. </p>
