Project Goal
-----------
For individuals affected by a disease and interested in participating in a clinical trial, the <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/" target="_blank">ClinicalTrials.gov website</a> does not fully meet their needs.
* The search functionality can be confusing
* There isn't a way to find out about future trials as they become available
* Not all trials are listed on ClinicalTrials.gov 

This project is a white labeled platform that leverages the clinicaltrials.gov data and allows users to match to trials based on location, age, sex, medications and other criteria. Any disease foundation can easily spin up a new instance of the site customized to their branding and disease type.
